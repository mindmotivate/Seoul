## AWS Launch Template Terraform Module Overview

This Terraform configuration defines an AWS Launch Template named "app1_LT" used for creating EC2 instances in the Seoul region.

- Launch Template Basics:
  - `resource "aws_launch_template" "app1_LT" {`: Initiates the definition of an AWS Launch Template.

- Template Settings:
  - `name_prefix   = "app1_LT"`: Sets a prefix for the launch template name.
  - `image_id      = "ami-098940df4d3292e9a"`: Specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for the instance.
  - `instance_type = "t2.micro"`: Defines the instance type as t2.micro.

## Key Pair Configuration:

### `key_name` Field:

- The line `key_name = "Seoul"` associates the launch template with a pre-existing SSH key pair named "Seoul." If you have a specific key pair you'd like to use, uncomment this line and replace "Seoul" with the name of your existing key pair.

### Commented Out Line:

- The line `#key_name = "Seoul"` is currently commented out. This means it is inactive and won't affect your launch template. If you have an existing key pair that you want to use and you do not want to generate a new key pair using the `Keys.tf` module, you may uncomment this line and replace "Seoul" with the name of your existing key pair. Be cautious, as using this line will override the key generated by the `Keys.tf` module.

### Using the Commented Line with Existing Key:

- Uncomment and use this line only if you have a previously created SSH key pair that you want to associate with your EC2 instances. If you do not intend to use the `Keys.tf` module and want to rely on the key pair generated by the module, keep this line commented out.

**Note:** If you choose to use an existing key pair and prevent the `Keys.tf` module from generating a new key, ensure that the `Keys.tf` module is not included or is disabled in your Terraform configuration to avoid potential conflicts.

- Security Group:
  - `vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.app1-sg01-servers.id]`: Specifies the security group for the instance.

- User Data Script:
  - `user_data`: Provides a Bash script as user data, configuring the instance with updates, Apache installation, and a custom HTML page.
  
- Tag Specifications:
  - Tags the created instance with metadata such as Name, Service, Owner, and Planet.

- Lifecycle Configuration:
  - `create_before_destroy = true`: Ensures new instances are created before old ones are destroyed during updates.


This Launch Template configuration is designed to facilitate the provisioning of EC2 instances with specific settings, including the AMI, instance type, key pair, security group, and user data for customization. It also includes tags for organizational purposes and a lifecycle configuration for seamless updates.
